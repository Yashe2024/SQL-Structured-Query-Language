Human Resources Data Management

Business Problem Overview

The HR department of a company was facing several challenges in managing employee records and departmental data effectively. These challenges included:

Employee Data Retrieval:

Difficulty in extracting specific employee information based on various criteria such as last name, department, and employment status.

Solution Overview
To address these challenges, a series of SQL queries and operations were developed. These solutions provided the ability to:

Update Employee Records:
Reassign employees to different departments, add new employees, and handle employee departures.
Manage Organizational Changes:
Implement changes such as reducing budgets across all departments and reassigning employees from one department to another.
