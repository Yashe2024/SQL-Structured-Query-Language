Technologies and Tools
SQL: The standard language for relational database management systems (RDBMS), used to perform various operations such as querying, updating, and managing data.
Database Management Systems (DBMS): Tools like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server, which implement SQL to manage databases.
Query Editors: Tools like MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), and others that provide a graphical interface for writing and executing SQL queries.
SQL Clients: Applications that allow you to interact with databases via SQL commands, often providing features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and query visualization.

Requirements
SQL-Compatible Database: Ensure you have access to a SQL-compatible database, whether it's MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or another RDBMS.
Basic Understanding of Database Concepts: Familiarity with basic database concepts such as tables, rows, and columns will be helpful.
SQL Client or Query Editor: Use a SQL client or query editor to write and execute SQL queries on your database.
